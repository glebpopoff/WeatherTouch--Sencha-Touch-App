SenchaWeather - Hourly Weather Forecast Sencha Touch Web App

- HTML templates are in /templates/ folder: index.html (touch version), desktop.html (about the app page)
- AppConfig.py is where you put in WeatherBug API key and Google Maps API keys
- All Sencha goodness is in the static/js folder

Drop me a note if you have any questions
